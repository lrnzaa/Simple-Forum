           <b> How to replace the "exposure triangle"; what to call it and are there alternative graphics?</b>
        </p>
        <p id="ans1" style=" text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">
            Is it then appropriate to include ISO, shutter speed, and aperture on a triangle but instead of it being the exposure triangle call it the 
            "brightness" or "lightness" triangle?  I thought this was a good idea at first but then I realized that ISO, although not directly affecting 
            image exposure, can force the camera to change its shutter speed or aperture size which does affect exposure, meaning the reciprocity between 
            those three settings is still valid in an exposure sense.  This leads me to believe that it should still be called the "exposure triangle," 
            just with some extra caveats.
            Also, do any forum members know where I could find an accurate "exposure" triangle with the right relationships?

            Exposure triangle is perfectly fine, it explains things well to the beginner.  Change only a few words and it should become acceptable. 
            So "image brightness" is controlled by aperture, shutter, and ISO settings. 
            The words"brightness" and "setting" are the important changes.
            Aperture and shutter speed are straightforward, image brightness is what the user expects, how the electronics implement the ISO setting are 
            beyond what the beginner wants to think about.  And after all, these three settings all have an impact on image brightness.

            The graphic to use should show addition. More illumination increases exposure, wider apertures increase exposure, and slower shutter speeds 
            increase exposure. In many real world cases, if you open the aperture, you don't want a faster shutter.  
            Why would you want to keep the same exposure when you could use a higher exposure (which generally produces a less noisy image).Once the exposure
            is set by the above three factors, the ISO setting maps that exposure to how light/dark the image is. When teaching beginners, 
            I suggest you encourage them to use Auto-ISO. This allows the camera to select the highest reasonable exposure given the constraints of the other 
            camera settings.

            The camera sensor is exposed to the scene luminance (no matter whether being helped by a flash). This is the exposure itself. 
            One may determine the amount of the light hiting the sensor by changing aperture and shutter speed. 
            The exposure of the sensor to the light is determined solely by aperture and shutter speed. I would call this first step "sensor capture".
